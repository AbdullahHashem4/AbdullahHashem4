# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abdullah Hashem, a passionate individual who thrives on leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive business growth. My specialties lie in Data Analytics, Data Visualization, and Game Development, where I focus on delivering impactful outcomes and optimizing business portfolios.

## Background

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've honed my skills in Data Analysis, Java, SQL, and R, alongside tools like Microsoft Excel and Tableau. My project experiences range from analyzing website data for The Grammy Awards to developing multimedia projects and video games using Unity.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Central Michigan University, I'm enrolled in a global tech experience course, "Intro to Data Analytics," to deepen my understanding and gain practical insights into the field.

As a first-generation immigrant college student, born in Bangladesh and raised in Qatar, I bring a diverse perspective and a strong work ethic to every endeavor. My ultimate goal is to gain hands-on experience as a Data Analyst, understand the industry dynamics, and pursue a Master's degree in the future.
